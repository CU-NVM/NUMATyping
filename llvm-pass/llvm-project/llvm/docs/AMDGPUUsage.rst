Introduction
============

The AMDGPU backend provides ISA code generation for AMD GPUs, starting with the
R600 family up until the current GCN families. It lives in the
``llvm/lib/Target/AMDGPU`` directory.

.. _amdgpu-processors:

Processors
----------

Use the Clang options ``-mcpu=<target-id>`` or ``--offload-arch=<target-id>`` to
specify the AMDGPU processor together with optional target features. See
:ref:`amdgpu-target-id` and :ref:`amdgpu-target-features` for AMD GPU target
specific information.

Every processor supports every OS ABI (see :ref:`amdgpu-os`) with the following exceptions:

* ``amdhsa`` is not supported in ``r600`` architecture (see :ref:`amdgpu-architecture-table`).

.. _amdgpu-target-features:

Target Features
---------------

Target features control how code is generated to support certain
processor specific features. Not all target features are supported by
all processors. The runtime must ensure that the features supported by
the device used to execute the code match the features enabled when
generating the code. A mismatch of features may result in incorrect
execution, or a reduction in performance.

The target features supported by each processor is listed in
:ref:`amdgpu-processor-table`.

Target features are controlled by exactly one of the following Clang
options:

``-mcpu=<target-id>`` or ``--offload-arch=<target-id>``

  The ``-mcpu`` and ``--offload-arch`` can specify the target feature as
  optional components of the target ID. If omitted, the target feature has the
  ``any`` value. See :ref:`amdgpu-target-id`.

``-m[no-]<target-feature>``

  Target features not specified by the target ID are specified using a
  separate option. These target features can have an ``on`` or ``off``
  value.  ``on`` is specified by omitting the ``no-`` prefix, and
  ``off`` is specified by including the ``no-`` prefix. The default
  if not specified is ``off``.

For example:

``-mcpu=gfx908:xnack+``
  Enable the ``xnack`` feature.
``-mcpu=gfx908:xnack-``
  Disable the ``xnack`` feature.
``-mcumode``
  Enable the ``cumode`` feature.
``-mno-cumode``
  Disable the ``cumode`` feature.

.. _amdgpu-target-id:

Target ID
---------

AMDGPU supports target IDs. See `Clang Offload Bundler
<https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangOffloadBundler.html>`_ for a general
description. The AMDGPU target specific information is:

**processor**
  Is an AMDGPU processor or alternative processor name specified in
  :ref:`amdgpu-processor-table`. The non-canonical form target ID allows both
  the primary processor and alternative processor names. The canonical form
  target ID only allow the primary processor name.

**target-feature**
  Is a target feature name specified in :ref:`amdgpu-target-features-table` that
  is supported by the processor. The target features supported by each processor
  is specified in :ref:`amdgpu-processor-table`. Those that can be specified in
  a target ID are marked as being controlled by ``-mcpu`` and
  ``--offload-arch``. Each target feature must appear at most once in a target
  ID. The non-canonical form target ID allows the target features to be
  specified in any order. The canonical form target ID requires the target
  features to be specified in alphabetic order.

.. _amdgpu-target-id-v2-v3:

Code Object V2 to V3 Target ID
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The target ID syntax for code object V2 to V3 is the same as defined in `Clang
Offload Bundler <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangOffloadBundler.html>`_ except
when used in the :ref:`amdgpu-assembler-directive-amdgcn-target` assembler
directive and the bundle entry ID. In those cases it has the following BNF
syntax:

.. code::

  <target-id> ::== <processor> ( "+" <target-feature> )*

Where a target feature is omitted if *Off* and present if *On* or *Any*.

.. note::

  The code object V2 to V3 cannot represent *Any* and treats it the same as
  *On*.

.. _amdgpu-embedding-bundled-objects:

Embedding Bundled Code Objects
------------------------------

AMDGPU supports the HIP and OpenMP languages that perform code object embedding
as described in `Clang Offload Bundler
<https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangOffloadBundler.html>`_.

.. note::

  The target ID syntax used for code object V2 to V3 for a bundle entry ID
  differs from that used elsewhere. See :ref:`amdgpu-target-id-v2-v3`.

.. _amdgpu-address-spaces:

Address Spaces
--------------

The AMDGPU architecture supports a number of memory address spaces. The address
space names use the OpenCL standard names, with some additions.

The AMDGPU address spaces correspond to target architecture specific LLVM
address space numbers used in LLVM IR.

The AMDGPU address spaces are described in
:ref:`amdgpu-address-spaces-table`. Only 64-bit process address spaces are
supported for the ``amdgcn`` target.

**Generic**
  The generic address space is supported unless the *Target Properties* column
  of :ref:`amdgpu-processor-table` specifies *Does not support generic address
  space*.

  The generic address space uses the hardware flat address support for two fixed
  ranges of virtual addresses (the private and local apertures), that are
  outside the range of addressable global memory, to map from a flat address to
  a private or local address. This uses FLAT instructions that can take a flat
  address and access global, private (scratch), and group (LDS) memory depending
  on if the address is within one of the aperture ranges.

  Flat access to scratch requires hardware aperture setup and setup in the
  kernel prologue (see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-flat-scratch`). Flat
  access to LDS requires hardware aperture setup and M0 (GFX7-GFX8) register
  setup (see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-m0`).

  To convert between a private or group address space address (termed a segment
  address) and a flat address the base address of the corresponding aperture
  can be used. For GFX7-GFX8 these are available in the
  :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-hsa-aql-queue` the address of which can be obtained with
  Queue Ptr SGPR (see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state`). For
  GFX9-GFX11 the aperture base addresses are directly available as inline
  constant registers ``SRC_SHARED_BASE/LIMIT`` and ``SRC_PRIVATE_BASE/LIMIT``.
  In 64-bit address mode the aperture sizes are 2^32 bytes and the base is
  aligned to 2^32 which makes it easier to convert from flat to segment or
  segment to flat.

  A global address space address has the same value when used as a flat address
  so no conversion is needed.

**Global and Constant**
  The global and constant address spaces both use global virtual addresses,
  which are the same virtual address space used by the CPU. However, some
  virtual addresses may only be accessible to the CPU, some only accessible
  by the GPU, and some by both.

  Using the constant address space indicates that the data will not change
  during the execution of the kernel. This allows scalar read instructions to
  be used. As the constant address space could only be modified on the host
  side, a generic pointer loaded from the constant address space is safe to be
  assumed as a global pointer since only the device global memory is visible
  and managed on the host side. The vector and scalar L1 caches are invalidated
  of volatile data before each kernel dispatch execution to allow constant
  memory to change values between kernel dispatches.

**Region**
  The region address space uses the hardware Global Data Store (GDS). All
  wavefronts executing on the same device will access the same memory for any
  given region address. However, the same region address accessed by wavefronts
  executing on different devices will access different memory. It is higher
  performance than global memory. It is allocated by the runtime. The data
  store (DS) instructions can be used to access it.

**Local**
  The local address space uses the hardware Local Data Store (LDS) which is
  automatically allocated when the hardware creates the wavefronts of a
  work-group, and freed when all the wavefronts of a work-group have
  terminated. All wavefronts belonging to the same work-group will access the
  same memory for any given local address. However, the same local address
  accessed by wavefronts belonging to different work-groups will access
  different memory. It is higher performance than global memory. The data store
  (DS) instructions can be used to access it.

**Private**
  The private address space uses the hardware scratch memory support which
  automatically allocates memory when it creates a wavefront and frees it when
  a wavefronts terminates. The memory accessed by a lane of a wavefront for any
  given private address will be different to the memory accessed by another lane
  of the same or different wavefront for the same private address.

  If a kernel dispatch uses scratch, then the hardware allocates memory from a
  pool of backing memory allocated by the runtime for each wavefront. The lanes
  of the wavefront access this using dword (4 byte) interleaving. The mapping
  used from private address to backing memory address is:

    ``wavefront-scratch-base +
    ((private-address / 4) * wavefront-size * 4) +
    (wavefront-lane-id * 4) + (private-address % 4)``

  If each lane of a wavefront accesses the same private address, the
  interleaving results in adjacent dwords being accessed and hence requires
  fewer cache lines to be fetched.

  There are different ways that the wavefront scratch base address is
  determined by a wavefront (see
  :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state`).

  Scratch memory can be accessed in an interleaved manner using buffer
  instructions with the scratch buffer descriptor and per wavefront scratch
  offset, by the scratch instructions, or by flat instructions. Multi-dword
  access is not supported except by flat and scratch instructions in
  GFX9-GFX11.

  Code that manipulates the stack values in other lanes of a wavefront,
  such as by ``addrspacecast``-ing stack pointers to generic ones and taking offsets
  that reach other lanes or by explicitly constructing the scratch buffer descriptor,
  triggers undefined behavior when it modifies the scratch values of other lanes.
  The compiler may assume that such modifications do not occur.

**Constant 32-bit**
  *TODO*

**Buffer Fat Pointer**
  The buffer fat pointer is an experimental address space that is currently
  unsupported in the backend. It exposes a non-integral pointer that is in
  the future intended to support the modelling of 128-bit buffer descriptors
  plus a 32-bit offset into the buffer (in total encapsulating a 160-bit
  *pointer*), allowing normal LLVM load/store/atomic operations to be used to
  model the buffer descriptors used heavily in graphics workloads targeting
  the backend.

  The buffer descriptor used to construct a buffer fat pointer must be *raw*:
  the stride must be 0, the "add tid" flag bust be 0, the swizzle enable bits
  must be off, and the extent must be measured in bytes. (On subtargets where
  bounds checking may be disabled, buffer fat pointers may choose to enable
  it or not).

**Buffer Resource**
  The buffer resource pointer, in address space 8, is the newer form
  for representing buffer descriptors in AMDGPU IR, replacing their
  previous representation as `<4 x i32>`. It is a non-integral pointer
  that represents a 128-bit buffer descriptor resource (`V#`).

  Since, in general, a buffer resource supports complex addressing modes that cannot
  be easily represented in LLVM (such as implicit swizzled access to structured
  buffers), it is **illegal** to perform non-trivial address computations, such as
  ``getelementptr`` operations, on buffer resources. They may be passed to
  AMDGPU buffer intrinsics, and they may be converted to and from ``i128``.

  Casting a buffer resource to a buffer fat pointer is permitted and adds an offset
  of 0.

  Buffer resources can be created from 64-bit pointers (which should be either
  generic or global) using the `llvm.amdgcn.make.buffer.rsrc` intrinsic, which
  takes the pointer, which becomes the base of the resource,
  the 16-bit stride (and swzizzle control) field stored in bits `63:48` of a `V#`,
  the 32-bit NumRecords/extent field (bits `95:64`), and the 32-bit flags field
  (bits `127:96`). The specific interpretation of these fields varies by the
  target architecture and is detailed in the ISA descriptions.

**Streamout Registers**
  Dedicated registers used by the GS NGG Streamout Instructions. The register
  file is modelled as a memory in a distinct address space because it is indexed
  by an address-like offset in place of named registers, and because register
  accesses affect LGKMcnt. This is an internal address space used only by the
  compiler. Do not use this address space for IR pointers.

Memory Scopes
-------------

This section provides LLVM memory synchronization scopes supported by the AMDGPU
backend memory model when the target triple OS is ``amdhsa`` (see
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-model` and :ref:`amdgpu-target-triples`).

The memory model supported is based on the HSA memory model [HSA]_ which is
based in turn on HRF-indirect with scope inclusion [HRF]_. The happens-before
relation is transitive over the synchronizes-with relation independent of scope
and synchronizes-with allows the memory scope instances to be inclusive (see
table :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-llvm-sync-scopes-table`).

This is different to the OpenCL [OpenCL]_ memory model which does not have scope
inclusion and requires the memory scopes to exactly match. However, this
is conservatively correct for OpenCL.

                             other operations within the same address space.

     ``singlethread-one-as`` Same as ``singlethread`` but only synchronizes with
                             other operations within the same address space.

                                                   instruction does not natively support denormal
                                                   inputs.

  :ref:`llvm.stacksave.p5 <int_stacksave>`         Implemented, must use the alloca address space.
  :ref:`llvm.stackrestore.p5 <int_stackrestore>`   Implemented, must use the alloca address space.

  llvm.amdgcn.wave.reduce.umin                     Performs an arithmetic unsigned min reduction on the unsigned values
                                                   provided by each lane in the wavefront.
                                                   Intrinsic takes a hint for reduction strategy using second operand
                                                   0: Target default preference,
                                                   1: `Iterative strategy`, and
                                                   2: `DPP`.
                                                   If target does not support the DPP operations (e.g. gfx6/7),
                                                   reduction will be performed using default iterative strategy.
                                                   Intrinsic is currently only implemented for i32.

LLVM IR Attributes
------------------

The AMDGPU backend supports the following LLVM IR attributes.

  .. table:: AMDGPU LLVM IR Attributes
     :name: amdgpu-llvm-ir-attributes-table

     ======================================= ==========================================================
     LLVM Attribute                          Description
     ======================================= ==========================================================
     "amdgpu-flat-work-group-size"="min,max" Specify the minimum and maximum flat work group sizes that
                                             will be specified when the kernel is dispatched. Generated
                                             by the ``amdgpu_flat_work_group_size`` CLANG attribute [CLANG-ATTR]_.
                                             The IR implied default value is 1,1024. Clang may emit this attribute
                                             with more restrictive bounds depending on language defaults.
                                             If the actual block or workgroup size exceeds the limit at any point during
                                             the execution, the behavior is undefined. For example, even if there is
                                             only one active thread but the thread local id exceeds the limit, the
                                             behavior is undefined.

     "amdgpu-implicitarg-num-bytes"="n"      Number of kernel argument bytes to add to the kernel
                                             argument block size for the implicit arguments. This
                                             varies by OS and language (for OpenCL see
                                             :ref:`opencl-kernel-implicit-arguments-appended-for-amdhsa-os-table`).
     "amdgpu-num-sgpr"="n"                   Specifies the number of SGPRs to use. Generated by
                                             the ``amdgpu_num_sgpr`` CLANG attribute [CLANG-ATTR]_.
     "amdgpu-num-vgpr"="n"                   Specifies the number of VGPRs to use. Generated by the
                                             ``amdgpu_num_vgpr`` CLANG attribute [CLANG-ATTR]_.
     "amdgpu-waves-per-eu"="m,n"             Specify the minimum and maximum number of waves per
                                             execution unit. Generated by the ``amdgpu_waves_per_eu``
                                             CLANG attribute [CLANG-ATTR]_. This is an optimization hint,
                                             and the backend may not be able to satisfy the request. If
                                             the specified range is incompatible with the function's
                                             "amdgpu-flat-work-group-size" value, the implied occupancy
                                             bounds by the workgroup size takes precedence.

     "amdgpu-ieee" true/false.               Specify whether the function expects the IEEE field of the
                                             mode register to be set on entry. Overrides the default for
                                             the calling convention.
     "amdgpu-dx10-clamp" true/false.         Specify whether the function expects the DX10_CLAMP field of
                                             the mode register to be set on entry. Overrides the default
                                             for the calling convention.

     "amdgpu-no-workitem-id-x"               Indicates the function does not depend on the value of the
                                             llvm.amdgcn.workitem.id.x intrinsic. If a function is marked with this
                                             attribute, or reached through a call site marked with this attribute,
                                             the value returned by the intrinsic is undefined. The backend can
                                             generally infer this during code generation, so typically there is no
                                             benefit to frontends marking functions with this.

     "amdgpu-no-workitem-id-y"               The same as amdgpu-no-workitem-id-x, except for the
                                             llvm.amdgcn.workitem.id.y intrinsic.

     "amdgpu-no-workitem-id-z"               The same as amdgpu-no-workitem-id-x, except for the
                                             llvm.amdgcn.workitem.id.z intrinsic.

     "amdgpu-no-workgroup-id-x"              The same as amdgpu-no-workitem-id-x, except for the
                                             llvm.amdgcn.workgroup.id.x intrinsic.

     "amdgpu-no-workgroup-id-y"              The same as amdgpu-no-workitem-id-x, except for the
                                             llvm.amdgcn.workgroup.id.y intrinsic.

     "amdgpu-no-workgroup-id-z"              The same as amdgpu-no-workitem-id-x, except for the
                                             llvm.amdgcn.workgroup.id.z intrinsic.

     "amdgpu-no-dispatch-ptr"                The same as amdgpu-no-workitem-id-x, except for the
                                             llvm.amdgcn.dispatch.ptr intrinsic.

     "amdgpu-no-implicitarg-ptr"             The same as amdgpu-no-workitem-id-x, except for the
                                             llvm.amdgcn.implicitarg.ptr intrinsic.

     "amdgpu-no-dispatch-id"                 The same as amdgpu-no-workitem-id-x, except for the
                                             llvm.amdgcn.dispatch.id intrinsic.

     "amdgpu-no-queue-ptr"                   Similar to amdgpu-no-workitem-id-x, except for the
                                             llvm.amdgcn.queue.ptr intrinsic. Note that unlike the other ABI hint
                                             attributes, the queue pointer may be required in situations where the
                                             intrinsic call does not directly appear in the program. Some subtargets
                                             require the queue pointer for to handle some addrspacecasts, as well
                                             as the llvm.amdgcn.is.shared, llvm.amdgcn.is.private, llvm.trap, and
                                             llvm.debug intrinsics.

     "amdgpu-no-hostcall-ptr"                Similar to amdgpu-no-implicitarg-ptr, except specific to the implicit
                                             kernel argument that holds the pointer to the hostcall buffer. If this
                                             attribute is absent, then the amdgpu-no-implicitarg-ptr is also removed.

     "amdgpu-no-heap-ptr"                    Similar to amdgpu-no-implicitarg-ptr, except specific to the implicit
                                             kernel argument that holds the pointer to an initialized memory buffer
                                             that conforms to the requirements of the malloc/free device library V1
                                             version implementation. If this attribute is absent, then the
                                             amdgpu-no-implicitarg-ptr is also removed.

     "amdgpu-no-multigrid-sync-arg"          Similar to amdgpu-no-implicitarg-ptr, except specific to the implicit
                                             kernel argument that holds the multigrid synchronization pointer. If this
                                             attribute is absent, then the amdgpu-no-implicitarg-ptr is also removed.

     "amdgpu-no-default-queue"               Similar to amdgpu-no-implicitarg-ptr, except specific to the implicit
                                             kernel argument that holds the default queue pointer. If this
                                             attribute is absent, then the amdgpu-no-implicitarg-ptr is also removed.

     "amdgpu-no-completion-action"           Similar to amdgpu-no-implicitarg-ptr, except specific to the implicit
                                             kernel argument that holds the completion action pointer. If this
                                             attribute is absent, then the amdgpu-no-implicitarg-ptr is also removed.

     "amdgpu-lds-size"="min[,max]"           Min is the minimum number of bytes that will be allocated in the Local
                                             Data Store at address zero. Variables are allocated within this frame
                                             using absolute symbol metadata, primarily by the AMDGPULowerModuleLDS
                                             pass. Optional max is the maximum number of bytes that will be allocated.
                                             Note that min==max indicates that no further variables can be added to
                                             the frame. This is an internal detail of how LDS variables are lowered,
                                             language front ends should not set this attribute.

Calling Conventions
-------------------

The AMDGPU backend supports the following calling conventions:

  .. table:: AMDGPU Calling Conventions
     :name: amdgpu-cc

     =============================== ==========================================================
     Calling Convention              Description
     =============================== ==========================================================
     ``ccc``                         The C calling convention. Used by default.
                                     See :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-function-call-convention-non-kernel-functions`
                                     for more details.

     ``fastcc``                      The fast calling convention. Mostly the same as the ``ccc``.

     ``coldcc``                      The cold calling convention. Mostly the same as the ``ccc``.

     ``amdgpu_cs``                   Used for Mesa/AMDPAL compute shaders.

     ``amdgpu_cs_chain``             Similar to ``amdgpu_cs``, with differences described below.

                                     Functions with this calling convention cannot be called directly. They must
                                     instead be launched via the ``llvm.amdgcn.cs.chain`` intrinsic.

                                     Arguments are passed in SGPRs, starting at s0, if they have the ``inreg``
                                     attribute, and in VGPRs otherwise, starting at v8. Using more SGPRs or VGPRs
                                     than available in the subtarget is not allowed.  On subtargets that use
                                     a scratch buffer descriptor (as opposed to ``scratch_{load,store}_*`` instructions),
                                     the scratch buffer descriptor is passed in s[48:51]. This limits the
                                     SGPR / ``inreg`` arguments to the equivalent of 48 dwords; using more
                                     than that is not allowed.

                                     The return type must be void.
                                     Varargs, sret, byval, byref, inalloca, preallocated are not supported.

                                     Values in scalar registers as well as v0-v7 are not preserved. Values in
                                     VGPRs starting at v8 are not preserved for the active lanes, but must be
                                     saved by the callee for inactive lanes when using WWM.

                                     Wave scratch is "empty" at function boundaries. There is no stack pointer input
                                     or output value, but functions are free to use scratch starting from an initial
                                     stack pointer. Calls to ``amdgpu_gfx`` functions are allowed and behave like they
                                     do in ``amdgpu_cs`` functions.

                                     All counters (``lgkmcnt``, ``vmcnt``, ``storecnt``, etc.) are presumed in an
                                     unknown state at function entry.

                                     A function may have multiple exits (e.g. one chain exit and one plain ``ret void``
                                     for when the wave ends), but all ``llvm.amdgcn.cs.chain`` exits must be in
                                     uniform control flow.

     ``amdgpu_cs_chain_preserve``    Same as ``amdgpu_cs_chain``, but active lanes for VGPRs starting at v8 are preserved.

     ``amdgpu_es``                   Used for AMDPAL shader stage before geometry shader if geometry is in
                                     use. So either the domain (= tessellation evaluation) shader if
                                     tessellation is in use, or otherwise the vertex shader.

``e_ident[EI_CLASS]``
  The ELF class is:

  * ``ELFCLASS32`` for ``r600`` architecture.

  * ``ELFCLASS64`` for ``amdgcn`` architecture which only supports 64-bit
    process address space applications.

``e_ident[EI_DATA]``
  All AMDGPU targets use ``ELFDATA2LSB`` for little-endian byte ordering.

``e_ident[EI_OSABI]``
  One of the following AMDGPU target architecture specific OS ABIs
  (see :ref:`amdgpu-os`):

  * ``ELFOSABI_NONE`` for *unknown* OS.

  * ``ELFOSABI_AMDGPU_HSA`` for ``amdhsa`` OS.

  * ``ELFOSABI_AMDGPU_PAL`` for ``amdpal`` OS.

  * ``ELFOSABI_AMDGPU_MESA3D`` for ``mesa3D`` OS.

``e_ident[EI_ABIVERSION]``
  The ABI version of the AMDGPU target architecture specific OS ABI to which the code
  object conforms:

  * ``ELFABIVERSION_AMDGPU_HSA_V2`` is used to specify the version of AMD HSA
    runtime ABI for code object V2. Specify using the Clang option
    ``-mcode-object-version=2``.

  * ``ELFABIVERSION_AMDGPU_HSA_V3`` is used to specify the version of AMD HSA
    runtime ABI for code object V3. Specify using the Clang option
    ``-mcode-object-version=3``.

  * ``ELFABIVERSION_AMDGPU_HSA_V4`` is used to specify the version of AMD HSA
    runtime ABI for code object V4. Specify using the Clang option
    ``-mcode-object-version=4``. This is the default code object
    version if not specified.

  * ``ELFABIVERSION_AMDGPU_HSA_V5`` is used to specify the version of AMD HSA
    runtime ABI for code object V5. Specify using the Clang option
    ``-mcode-object-version=5``.

  * ``ELFABIVERSION_AMDGPU_PAL`` is used to specify the version of AMD PAL
    runtime ABI.

  * ``ELFABIVERSION_AMDGPU_MESA3D`` is used to specify the version of AMD MESA
    3D runtime ABI.

``e_type``
  Can be one of the following values:


  ``ET_REL``
    The type produced by the AMDGPU backend compiler as it is relocatable code
    object.

  ``ET_DYN``
    The type produced by the linker as it is a shared code object.

  The AMD HSA runtime loader requires a ``ET_DYN`` code object.

``e_machine``
  The value ``EM_AMDGPU`` is used for the machine for all processors supported
  by the ``r600`` and ``amdgcn`` architectures (see
  :ref:`amdgpu-processor-table`). The specific processor is specified in the
  ``NT_AMD_HSA_ISA_VERSION`` note record for code object V2 (see
  :ref:`amdgpu-note-records-v2`) and in the ``EF_AMDGPU_MACH`` bit field of the
  ``e_flags`` for code object V3 and above (see
  :ref:`amdgpu-elf-header-e_flags-table-v3` and
  :ref:`amdgpu-elf-header-e_flags-table-v4-onwards`).

``e_entry``
  The entry point is 0 as the entry points for individual kernels must be
  selected in order to invoke them through AQL packets.

``e_flags``
  The AMDGPU backend uses the following ELF header flags:

     ================== ================ =================================

These sections have their standard meanings (see [ELF]_) and are only generated
if needed.

``.debug``\ *\**
  The standard DWARF sections. See :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-debug-information` for
  information on the DWARF produced by the AMDGPU backend.

``.dynamic``, ``.dynstr``, ``.dynsym``, ``.hash``
  The standard sections used by a dynamic loader.

``.note``
  See :ref:`amdgpu-note-records` for the note records supported by the AMDGPU
  backend.

``.rela``\ *name*, ``.rela.dyn``
  For relocatable code objects, *name* is the name of the section that the
  relocation records apply. For example, ``.rela.text`` is the section name for
  relocation records associated with the ``.text`` section.

  For linked shared code objects, ``.rela.dyn`` contains all the relocation
  records from each of the relocatable code object's ``.rela``\ *name* sections.

  See :ref:`amdgpu-relocation-records` for the relocation records supported by
  the AMDGPU backend.

``.text``
  The executable machine code for the kernels and functions they call. Generated
  as position independent code. See :ref:`amdgpu-code-conventions` for
  information on conventions used in the isa generation.

.. _amdgpu-note-records:

Note Records
------------

The AMDGPU backend code object contains ELF note records in the ``.note``
section. The set of generated notes and their semantics depend on the code
object version; see :ref:`amdgpu-note-records-v2` and
:ref:`amdgpu-note-records-v3-onwards`.

As required by ``ELFCLASS32`` and ``ELFCLASS64``, minimal zero-byte padding
must be generated after the ``name`` field to ensure the ``desc`` field is 4
byte aligned. In addition, minimal zero-byte padding must be generated to
ensure the ``desc`` field size is a multiple of 4 bytes. The ``sh_addralign``
field of the ``.note`` section must be at least 4 to indicate at least 8 byte
alignment.

``NT_AMD_HSA_CODE_OBJECT_VERSION``
  Specifies the code object version number. The description field has the
  following layout:

  .. code:: c

    struct amdgpu_hsa_note_code_object_version_s {
      uint32_t major_version;
      uint32_t minor_version;
    };

  The ``major_version`` has a value less than or equal to 2.

``NT_AMD_HSA_HSAIL``
  Specifies the HSAIL properties used by the HSAIL Finalizer. The description
  field has the following layout:

  .. code:: c

    struct amdgpu_hsa_note_hsail_s {
      uint32_t hsail_major_version;
      uint32_t hsail_minor_version;
      uint8_t profile;
      uint8_t machine_model;
      uint8_t default_float_round;
    };

``NT_AMD_HSA_ISA_VERSION``
  Specifies the target ISA version. The description field has the following layout:

  .. code:: c

    struct amdgpu_hsa_note_isa_s {
      uint16_t vendor_name_size;
      uint16_t architecture_name_size;
      uint32_t major;
      uint32_t minor;
      uint32_t stepping;
      char vendor_and_architecture_name[1];
    };

  ``vendor_name_size`` and ``architecture_name_size`` are the length of the
  vendor and architecture names respectively, including the NUL character.

  ``vendor_and_architecture_name`` contains the NUL terminates string for the
  vendor, immediately followed by the NUL terminated string for the
  architecture.

  This note record is used by the HSA runtime loader.

  Code object V2 only supports a limited number of processors and has fixed
  settings for target features. See
  :ref:`amdgpu-elf-note-record-supported_processors-v2-table` for a list of
  processors and the corresponding target ID. In the table the note record ISA
  name is a concatenation of the vendor name, architecture name, major, minor,
  and stepping separated by a ":".

  The target ID column shows the processor name and fixed target features used
  by the LLVM compiler. The LLVM compiler does not generate a
  ``NT_AMD_HSA_HSAIL`` note record.

  A code object generated by the Finalizer also uses code object V2 and always
  generates a ``NT_AMD_HSA_HSAIL`` note record. The processor name and
  ``sramecc`` target feature is as shown in
  :ref:`amdgpu-elf-note-record-supported_processors-v2-table` but the ``xnack``
  target feature is specified by the ``EF_AMDGPU_FEATURE_XNACK_V2`` ``e_flags``
  bit.

``NT_AMD_HSA_ISA_NAME``
  Specifies the target ISA name as a non-NUL terminated string.

  This note record is not used by the HSA runtime loader.

  See the ``NT_AMD_HSA_ISA_VERSION`` note record description of the code object
  V2's limited support of processors and fixed settings for target features.

  See :ref:`amdgpu-elf-note-record-supported_processors-v2-table` for a mapping
  from the string to the corresponding target ID. If the ``xnack`` target
  feature is supported and enabled, the string produced by the LLVM compiler
  will may have a ``+xnack`` appended. The Finlizer did not do the appending and
  instead used the ``EF_AMDGPU_FEATURE_XNACK_V2`` ``e_flags`` bit.

``NT_AMD_HSA_METADATA``
  Specifies extensible metadata associated with the code objects executed on HSA
  [HSA]_ compatible runtimes (see :ref:`amdgpu-os`). It is required when the
  target triple OS is ``amdhsa`` (see :ref:`amdgpu-target-triples`). See
  :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-code-object-metadata-v2` for the syntax of the code object
  metadata string.

     ===================== ================== ================ ==================

Global variable
  Global variables both used and defined by the compilation unit.

  If the symbol is defined in the compilation unit then it is allocated in the
  appropriate section according to if it has initialized data or is readonly.

  If the symbol is external then its section is ``STN_UNDEF`` and the loader
  will resolve relocations using the definition provided by another code object
  or explicitly defined by the runtime.

  If the symbol resides in local/group memory (LDS) then its section is the
  special processor specific section name ``SHN_AMDGPU_LDS``, and the
  ``st_value`` field describes alignment requirements as it does for common
  symbols.

  .. TODO::

     Add description of linked shared object symbols. Seems undefined symbols
     are marked as STT_NOTYPE.

Kernel descriptor
  Every HSA kernel has an associated kernel descriptor. It is the address of the
  kernel descriptor that is used in the AQL dispatch packet used to invoke the
  kernel, not the kernel entry point. The layout of the HSA kernel descriptor is
  defined in :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-descriptor`.

Kernel entry point
  Every HSA kernel also has a symbol for its machine code entry point.

.. _amdgpu-relocation-records:

Relocation Records
------------------

AMDGPU backend generates ``Elf64_Rela`` relocation records. Supported
relocatable fields are:

``word32``
  This specifies a 32-bit field occupying 4 bytes with arbitrary byte
  alignment. These values use the same byte order as other word values in the
  AMDGPU architecture.

``word64``
  This specifies a 64-bit field occupying 8 bytes with arbitrary byte
  alignment. These values use the same byte order as other word values in the
  AMDGPU architecture.

Following notations are used for specifying relocation calculations:

**A**
  Represents the addend used to compute the value of the relocatable field.

**G**
  Represents the offset into the global offset table at which the relocation
  entry's symbol will reside during execution.

**GOT**
  Represents the address of the global offset table.

**P**
  Represents the place (section offset for ``et_rel`` or address for ``et_dyn``)
  of the storage unit being relocated (computed using ``r_offset``).

**S**
  Represents the value of the symbol whose index resides in the relocation
  entry. Relocations not using this must specify a symbol index of
  ``STN_UNDEF``.

**B**
  Represents the base address of a loaded executable or shared object which is
  the difference between the ELF address and the actual load address.
  Relocations using this are only valid in executable or shared objects.

The following relocation types are supported:

``R_AMDGPU_ABS32_LO`` and ``R_AMDGPU_ABS32_HI`` are only supported by
the ``mesa3d`` OS, which does not support ``R_AMDGPU_ABS64``.

There is no current OS loader support for 32-bit programs and so
``R_AMDGPU_ABS32`` is not used.

.. _amdgpu-loaded-code-object-path-uniform-resource-identifier:

Loaded Code Object Path Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
---------------------------------------------------------

The AMD GPU code object loader represents the path of the ELF shared object from
which the code object was loaded as a textual Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).
Note that the code object is the in memory loaded relocated form of the ELF
shared object.  Multiple code objects may be loaded at different memory
addresses in the same process from the same ELF shared object.

The loaded code object path URI syntax is defined by the following BNF syntax:

.. code::

  code_object_uri ::== file_uri | memory_uri
  file_uri        ::== "file://" file_path [ range_specifier ]
  memory_uri      ::== "memory://" process_id range_specifier
  range_specifier ::== [ "#" | "?" ] "offset=" number "&" "size=" number
  file_path       ::== URI_ENCODED_OS_FILE_PATH
  process_id      ::== DECIMAL_NUMBER
  number          ::== HEX_NUMBER | DECIMAL_NUMBER | OCTAL_NUMBER

**number**
  Is a C integral literal where hexadecimal values are prefixed by "0x" or "0X",
  and octal values by "0".

**file_path**
  Is the file's path specified as a URI encoded UTF-8 string. In URI encoding,
  every character that is not in the regular expression ``[a-zA-Z0-9/_.~-]`` is
  encoded as two uppercase hexadecimal digits proceeded by "%".  Directories in
  the path are separated by "/".

**offset**
  Is a 0-based byte offset to the start of the code object.  For a file URI, it
  is from the start of the file specified by the ``file_path``, and if omitted
  defaults to 0. For a memory URI, it is the memory address and is required.

**size**
  Is the number of bytes in the code object.  For a file URI, if omitted it
  defaults to the size of the file.  It is required for a memory URI.

**process_id**
  Is the identity of the process owning the memory.  For Linux it is the C
  unsigned integral decimal literal for the process ID (PID).

For example:

.. code::

  file:///dir1/dir2/file1
  file:///dir3/dir4/file2#offset=0x2000&size=3000
  memory://1234#offset=0x20000&size=3000

.. _amdgpu-dwarf-debug-information:

DWARF Debug Information
=======================

.. warning::

   This section describes **provisional support** for AMDGPU DWARF [DWARF]_ that
   is not currently fully implemented and is subject to change.

AMDGPU generates DWARF [DWARF]_ debugging information ELF sections (see
:ref:`amdgpu-elf-code-object`) which contain information that maps the code
object executable code and data to the source language constructs. It can be
used by tools such as debuggers and profilers. It uses features defined in
:doc:`AMDGPUDwarfExtensionsForHeterogeneousDebugging` that are made available in
DWARF Version 4 and DWARF Version 5 as an LLVM vendor extension.

This section defines the AMDGPU target architecture specific DWARF mappings.

.. _amdgpu-dwarf-register-identifier:

Register Identifier
-------------------

This section defines the AMDGPU target architecture register numbers used in
DWARF operation expressions (see DWARF Version 5 section 2.5 and
:ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-operation-expressions`) and Call Frame Information
instructions (see DWARF Version 5 section 6.4 and
:ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-call-frame-information`).

A single code object can contain code for kernels that have different wavefront
sizes. The vector registers and some scalar registers are based on the wavefront
size. AMDGPU defines distinct DWARF registers for each wavefront size. This
simplifies the consumer of the DWARF so that each register has a fixed size,
rather than being dynamic according to the wavefront size mode. Similarly,
distinct DWARF registers are defined for those registers that vary in size
according to the process address size. This allows a consumer to treat a
specific AMDGPU processor as a single architecture regardless of how it is
configured at run time. The compiler explicitly specifies the DWARF registers
that match the mode in which the code it is generating will be executed.

DWARF registers are encoded as numbers, which are mapped to architecture
registers. The mapping for AMDGPU is defined in
:ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-register-mapping-table`. All AMDGPU targets use the same
mapping.

   ============== ================= ======== ==================================

The vector registers are represented as the full size for the wavefront. They
are organized as consecutive dwords (32-bits), one per lane, with the dword at
the least significant bit position corresponding to lane 0 and so forth. DWARF
location expressions involving the ``DW_OP_LLVM_offset`` and
``DW_OP_LLVM_push_lane`` operations are used to select the part of the vector
register corresponding to the lane that is executing the current thread of
execution in languages that are implemented using a SIMD or SIMT execution
model.

If the wavefront size is 32 lanes then the wavefront 32 mode register
definitions are used. If the wavefront size is 64 lanes then the wavefront 64
mode register definitions are used. Some AMDGPU targets support executing in
both wavefront 32 and wavefront 64 mode. The register definitions corresponding
to the wavefront mode of the generated code will be used.

If code is generated to execute in a 32-bit process address space, then the
32-bit process address space register definitions are used. If code is generated
to execute in a 64-bit process address space, then the 64-bit process address
space register definitions are used. The ``amdgcn`` target only supports the
64-bit process address space.

See :ref:`amdgpu-address-spaces` for information on the AMDGPU LLVM IR address
spaces including address size and NULL value.

The ``DW_ASPACE_LLVM_none`` address space is the default target architecture
address space used in DWARF operations that do not specify an address space. It
therefore has to map to the global address space so that the ``DW_OP_addr*`` and
related operations can refer to addresses in the program code.

The ``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_generic`` address space allows location expressions to
specify the flat address space. If the address corresponds to an address in the
local address space, then it corresponds to the wavefront that is executing the
focused thread of execution. If the address corresponds to an address in the
private address space, then it corresponds to the lane that is executing the
focused thread of execution for languages that are implemented using a SIMD or
SIMT execution model.

.. note::

  CUDA-like languages such as HIP that do not have address spaces in the
  language type system, but do allow variables to be allocated in different
  address spaces, need to explicitly specify the ``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_generic``
  address space in the DWARF expression operations as the default address space
  is the global address space.

The ``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_local`` address space allows location expressions to
specify the local address space corresponding to the wavefront that is executing
the focused thread of execution.

The ``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_private_lane`` address space allows location expressions
to specify the private address space corresponding to the lane that is executing
the focused thread of execution for languages that are implemented using a SIMD
or SIMT execution model.

The ``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_private_wave`` address space allows location expressions
to specify the unswizzled private address space corresponding to the wavefront
that is executing the focused thread of execution. The wavefront view of private
memory is the per wavefront unswizzled backing memory layout defined in
:ref:`amdgpu-address-spaces`, such that address 0 corresponds to the first
location for the backing memory of the wavefront (namely the address is not
offset by ``wavefront-scratch-base``). The following formula can be used to
convert from a ``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_private_lane`` address to a
``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_private_wave`` address:

::

  private-address-wavefront =
    ((private-address-lane / 4) * wavefront-size * 4) +
    (wavefront-lane-id * 4) + (private-address-lane % 4)

If the ``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_private_lane`` address is dword aligned, and the start
of the dwords for each lane starting with lane 0 is required, then this
simplifies to:

::

  private-address-wavefront =
    private-address-lane * wavefront-size

A compiler can use the ``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_private_wave`` address space to read a
complete spilled vector register back into a complete vector register in the
CFI. The frame pointer can be a private lane address which is dword aligned,
which can be shifted to multiply by the wavefront size, and then used to form a
private wavefront address that gives a location for a contiguous set of dwords,
one per lane, where the vector register dwords are spilled. The compiler knows
the wavefront size since it generates the code. Note that the type of the
address may have to be converted as the size of a
``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_private_lane`` address may be smaller than the size of a
``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_private_wave`` address.

.. _amdgpu-dwarf-lane-identifier:

Lane identifier
---------------

DWARF lane identifies specify a target architecture lane position for hardware
that executes in a SIMD or SIMT manner, and on which a source language maps its
threads of execution onto those lanes. The DWARF lane identifier is pushed by
the ``DW_OP_LLVM_push_lane`` DWARF expression operation. See DWARF Version 5
section 2.5 which is updated by *DWARF Extensions For Heterogeneous Debugging*
section :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-operation-expressions`.

For AMDGPU, the lane identifier corresponds to the hardware lane ID of a
wavefront. It is numbered from 0 to the wavefront size minus 1.

Operation Expressions
---------------------

DWARF expressions are used to compute program values and the locations of
program objects. See DWARF Version 5 section 2.5 and
:ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-operation-expressions`.

DWARF location descriptions describe how to access storage which includes memory
and registers. When accessing storage on AMDGPU, bytes are ordered with least
significant bytes first, and bits are ordered within bytes with least
significant bits first.

For AMDGPU CFI expressions, ``DW_OP_LLVM_select_bit_piece`` is used to describe
unwinding vector registers that are spilled under the execution mask to memory:
the zero-single location description is the vector register, and the one-single
location description is the spilled memory location description. The
``DW_OP_LLVM_form_aspace_address`` is used to specify the address space of the
memory location description.

In AMDGPU expressions, ``DW_OP_LLVM_select_bit_piece`` is used by the
``DW_AT_LLVM_lane_pc`` attribute expression where divergent control flow is
controlled by the execution mask. An undefined location description together
with ``DW_OP_LLVM_extend`` is used to indicate the lane was not active on entry
to the subprogram. See :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-dw-at-llvm-lane-pc` for an example.

Debugger Information Entry Attributes
-------------------------------------

This section describes how certain debugger information entry attributes are
used by AMDGPU. See the sections in DWARF Version 5 section 3.3.5 and 3.1.1
which are updated by *DWARF Extensions For Heterogeneous Debugging* section
:ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-low-level-information` and
:ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-full-and-partial-compilation-unit-entries`.

.. _amdgpu-dwarf-dw-at-llvm-lane-pc:

``DW_AT_LLVM_lane_pc``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For AMDGPU, the ``DW_AT_LLVM_lane_pc`` attribute is used to specify the program
location of the separate lanes of a SIMT thread.

If the lane is an active lane then this will be the same as the current program
location.

If the lane is inactive, but was active on entry to the subprogram, then this is
the program location in the subprogram at which execution of the lane is
conceptual positioned.

If the lane was not active on entry to the subprogram, then this will be the
undefined location. A client debugger can check if the lane is part of a valid
work-group by checking that the lane is in the range of the associated
work-group within the grid, accounting for partial work-groups. If it is not,
then the debugger can omit any information for the lane. Otherwise, the debugger
may repeatedly unwind the stack and inspect the ``DW_AT_LLVM_lane_pc`` of the
calling subprogram until it finds a non-undefined location. Conceptually the
lane only has the call frames that it has a non-undefined
``DW_AT_LLVM_lane_pc``.

The following example illustrates how the AMDGPU backend can generate a DWARF
location list expression for the nested ``IF/THEN/ELSE`` structures of the
following subprogram pseudo code for a target with 64 lanes per wavefront.

.. code::
  :number-lines:

  SUBPROGRAM X
  BEGIN
    a;
    IF (c1) THEN
      b;
      IF (c2) THEN
        c;
      ELSE
        d;
      ENDIF
      e;
    ELSE
      f;
    ENDIF
    g;
  END

The AMDGPU backend may generate the following pseudo LLVM MIR to manipulate the
execution mask (``EXEC``) to linearize the control flow. The condition is
evaluated to make a mask of the lanes for which the condition evaluates to true.
First the ``THEN`` region is executed by setting the ``EXEC`` mask to the
logical ``AND`` of the current ``EXEC`` mask with the condition mask. Then the
``ELSE`` region is executed by negating the ``EXEC`` mask and logical ``AND`` of
the saved ``EXEC`` mask at the start of the region. After the ``IF/THEN/ELSE``
region the ``EXEC`` mask is restored to the value it had at the beginning of the
region. This is shown below. Other approaches are possible, but the basic
concept is the same.

.. code::
  :number-lines:

  $lex_start:
    a;
    %1 = EXEC
    %2 = c1
  $lex_1_start:
    EXEC = %1 & %2
  $if_1_then:
      b;
      %3 = EXEC
      %4 = c2
  $lex_1_1_start:
      EXEC = %3 & %4
  $lex_1_1_then:
        c;
      EXEC = ~EXEC & %3
  $lex_1_1_else:
        d;
      EXEC = %3
  $lex_1_1_end:
      e;
    EXEC = ~EXEC & %1
  $lex_1_else:
      f;
    EXEC = %1
  $lex_1_end:
    g;
  $lex_end:

To create the DWARF location list expression that defines the location
description of a vector of lane program locations, the LLVM MIR ``DBG_VALUE``
pseudo instruction can be used to annotate the linearized control flow. This can
be done by defining an artificial variable for the lane PC. The DWARF location
list expression created for it is used as the value of the
``DW_AT_LLVM_lane_pc`` attribute on the subprogram's debugger information entry.

A DWARF procedure is defined for each well nested structured control flow region
which provides the conceptual lane program location for a lane if it is not
active (namely it is divergent). The DWARF operation expression for each region
conceptually inherits the value of the immediately enclosing region and modifies
it according to the semantics of the region.

For an ``IF/THEN/ELSE`` region the divergent program location is at the start of
the region for the ``THEN`` region since it is executed first. For the ``ELSE``
region the divergent program location is at the end of the ``IF/THEN/ELSE``
region since the ``THEN`` region has completed.

The lane PC artificial variable is assigned at each region transition. It uses
the immediately enclosing region's DWARF procedure to compute the program
location for each lane assuming they are divergent, and then modifies the result
by inserting the current program location for each lane that the ``EXEC`` mask
indicates is active.

By having separate DWARF procedures for each region, they can be reused to
define the value for any nested region. This reduces the total size of the DWARF
operation expressions.

The following provides an example using pseudo LLVM MIR.

The DWARF procedure ``%__active_lane_pc`` is used to update the lane pc elements
that are active, with the current program location.

Artificial variables %__lex_1_save_exec and %__lex_1_1_save_exec are created for
the execution masks saved on entry to a region. Using the ``DBG_VALUE`` pseudo
instruction, location list entries will be created that describe where the
artificial variables are allocated at any given program location. The compiler
may allocate them to registers or spill them to memory.

The DWARF procedures for each region use the values of the saved execution mask
artificial variables to only update the lanes that are active on entry to the
region. All other lanes retain the value of the enclosing region where they were
last active. If they were not active on entry to the subprogram, then will have
the undefined location description.

Other structured control flow regions can be handled similarly. For example,
loops would set the divergent program location for the region at the end of the
loop. Any lanes active will be in the loop, and any lanes not active must have
exited the loop.

An ``IF/THEN/ELSEIF/ELSEIF/...`` region can be treated as a nest of
``IF/THEN/ELSE`` regions.

The DWARF procedures can use the active lane artificial variable described in
:ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-amdgpu-dw-at-llvm-active-lane` rather than the actual
``EXEC`` mask in order to support whole or quad wavefront mode.

.. _amdgpu-dwarf-amdgpu-dw-at-llvm-active-lane:

``DW_AT_LLVM_active_lane``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``DW_AT_LLVM_active_lane`` attribute on a subprogram debugger information
entry is used to specify the lanes that are conceptually active for a SIMT
thread.

The execution mask may be modified to implement whole or quad wavefront mode
operations. For example, all lanes may need to temporarily be made active to
execute a whole wavefront operation. Such regions would save the ``EXEC`` mask,
update it to enable the necessary lanes, perform the operations, and then
restore the ``EXEC`` mask from the saved value. While executing the whole
wavefront region, the conceptual execution mask is the saved value, not the
``EXEC`` value.

This is handled by defining an artificial variable for the active lane mask. The
active lane mask artificial variable would be the actual ``EXEC`` mask for
normal regions, and the saved execution mask for regions where the mask is
temporarily updated. The location list expression created for this artificial
variable is used to define the value of the ``DW_AT_LLVM_active_lane``
attribute.

``DW_AT_LLVM_augmentation``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For AMDGPU, the ``DW_AT_LLVM_augmentation`` attribute of a compilation unit
debugger information entry has the following value for the augmentation string:

::

  [amdgpu:v0.0]

The "vX.Y" specifies the major X and minor Y version number of the AMDGPU
extensions used in the DWARF of the compilation unit. The version number
conforms to [SEMVER]_.

Call Frame Information
----------------------

DWARF Call Frame Information (CFI) describes how a consumer can virtually
*unwind* call frames in a running process or core dump. See DWARF Version 5
section 6.4 and :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-call-frame-information`.

For AMDGPU, the Common Information Entry (CIE) fields have the following values:

1.  ``augmentation`` string contains the following null-terminated UTF-8 string:

    ::

      [amd:v0.0]

    The ``vX.Y`` specifies the major X and minor Y version number of the AMDGPU
    extensions used in this CIE or to the FDEs that use it. The version number
    conforms to [SEMVER]_.

2.  ``address_size`` for the ``Global`` address space is defined in
    :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-address-space-identifier`.

3.  ``segment_selector_size`` is 0 as AMDGPU does not use a segment selector.

4.  ``code_alignment_factor`` is 4 bytes.

    .. TODO::

       Add to :ref:`amdgpu-processor-table` table.

5.  ``data_alignment_factor`` is 4 bytes.

    .. TODO::

       Add to :ref:`amdgpu-processor-table` table.

6.  ``return_address_register`` is ``PC_32`` for 32-bit processes and ``PC_64``
    for 64-bit processes defined in :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-register-identifier`.

7.  ``initial_instructions`` Since a subprogram X with fewer registers can be
    called from subprogram Y that has more allocated, X will not change any of
    the extra registers as it cannot access them. Therefore, the default rule
    for all columns is ``same value``.

For AMDGPU the register number follows the numbering defined in
:ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-register-identifier`.

For AMDGPU the instructions are variable size. A consumer can subtract 1 from
the return address to get the address of a byte within the call site
instructions. See DWARF Version 5 section 6.4.4.

Accelerated Access
------------------

See DWARF Version 5 section 6.1.

Lookup By Name Section Header
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See DWARF Version 5 section 6.1.1.4.1 and :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-lookup-by-name`.

For AMDGPU the lookup by name section header table:

``augmentation_string_size`` (uword)

  Set to the length of the ``augmentation_string`` value which is always a
  multiple of 4.

``augmentation_string`` (sequence of UTF-8 characters)

  Contains the following UTF-8 string null padded to a multiple of 4 bytes:

  ::

    [amdgpu:v0.0]

  The "vX.Y" specifies the major X and minor Y version number of the AMDGPU
  extensions used in the DWARF of this index. The version number conforms to
  [SEMVER]_.

  .. note::

    This is different to the DWARF Version 5 definition that requires the first
    4 characters to be the vendor ID. But this is consistent with the other
    augmentation strings and does allow multiple vendor contributions. However,
    backwards compatibility may be more desirable.

Lookup By Address Section Header
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See DWARF Version 5 section 6.1.2.

For AMDGPU the lookup by address section header table:

``address_size`` (ubyte)

  Match the address size for the ``Global`` address space defined in
  :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-address-space-identifier`.

``segment_selector_size`` (ubyte)

  AMDGPU does not use a segment selector so this is 0. The entries in the
  ``.debug_aranges`` do not have a segment selector.

Line Number Information
-----------------------

See DWARF Version 5 section 6.2 and :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-line-number-information`.

AMDGPU does not use the ``isa`` state machine registers and always sets it to 0.
The instruction set must be obtained from the ELF file header ``e_flags`` field
in the ``EF_AMDGPU_MACH`` bit position (see :ref:`ELF Header
<amdgpu-elf-header>`). See DWARF Version 5 section 6.2.2.

.. TODO::

  Should the ``isa`` state machine register be used to indicate if the code is
  in wavefront32 or wavefront64 mode? Or used to specify the architecture ISA?

For AMDGPU the line number program header fields have the following values (see
DWARF Version 5 section 6.2.4):

``address_size`` (ubyte)
  Matches the address size for the ``Global`` address space defined in
  :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-address-space-identifier`.

``segment_selector_size`` (ubyte)
  AMDGPU does not use a segment selector so this is 0.

``minimum_instruction_length`` (ubyte)
  For GFX9-GFX11 this is 4.

``maximum_operations_per_instruction`` (ubyte)
  For GFX9-GFX11 this is 1.

Source text for online-compiled programs (for example, those compiled by the
OpenCL language runtime) may be embedded into the DWARF Version 5 line table.
See DWARF Version 5 section 6.2.4.1 which is updated by *DWARF Extensions For
Heterogeneous Debugging* section :ref:`DW_LNCT_LLVM_source
<amdgpu-dwarf-line-number-information-dw-lnct-llvm-source>`.

The Clang option used to control source embedding in AMDGPU is defined in
:ref:`amdgpu-clang-debug-options-table`.

     ==================== ==================================================
     Debug Flag           Description
     ==================== ==================================================
     -g[no-]embed-source  Enable/disable embedding source text in DWARF
                          debug sections. Useful for environments where
                          source cannot be written to disk, such as
                          when performing online compilation.
     ==================== ==================================================

For example:

``-gembed-source``
  Enable the embedded source.

``-gno-embed-source``
  Disable the embedded source.

32-Bit and 64-Bit DWARF Formats
-------------------------------

See DWARF Version 5 section 7.4 and
:ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-32-bit-and-64-bit-dwarf-formats`.

For AMDGPU:

* For the ``amdgcn`` target architecture only the 64-bit process address space
  is supported.

* The producer can generate either 32-bit or 64-bit DWARF format. LLVM generates
  the 32-bit DWARF format.

Unit Headers
------------

For AMDGPU the following values apply for each of the unit headers described in
DWARF Version 5 sections 7.5.1.1, 7.5.1.2, and 7.5.1.3:

``address_size`` (ubyte)
  Matches the address size for the ``Global`` address space defined in
  :ref:`amdgpu-dwarf-address-space-identifier`.

Code Conventions
================

This section provides code conventions used for each supported target triple OS
(see :ref:`amdgpu-target-triples`).

AMDHSA
------

This section provides code conventions used when the target triple OS is
``amdhsa`` (see :ref:`amdgpu-target-triples`).

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-code-object-metadata:

Code Object Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The code object metadata specifies extensible metadata associated with the code
objects executed on HSA [HSA]_ compatible runtimes (see :ref:`amdgpu-os`). The
encoding and semantics of this metadata depends on the code object version; see
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-code-object-metadata-v2`,
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-code-object-metadata-v3`,
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-code-object-metadata-v4` and
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-code-object-metadata-v5`.

Code object metadata is specified in a note record (see
:ref:`amdgpu-note-records`) and is required when the target triple OS is
``amdhsa`` (see :ref:`amdgpu-target-triples`). It must contain the minimum
information necessary to support the HSA compatible runtime kernel queries. For
example, the segment sizes needed in a dispatch packet. In addition, a
high-level language runtime may require other information to be included. For
example, the AMD OpenCL runtime records kernel argument information.

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-code-object-metadata-v2:

Code Object V2 Metadata
+++++++++++++++++++++++

.. warning::
  Code object V2 is not the default code object version emitted by this version
  of LLVM.

Code object V2 metadata is specified by the ``NT_AMD_HSA_METADATA`` note record
(see :ref:`amdgpu-note-records-v2`).

The metadata is specified as a YAML formatted string (see [YAML]_ and
:doc:`YamlIO`).

.. TODO::

  Is the string null terminated? It probably should not if YAML allows it to
  contain null characters, otherwise it should be.

The metadata is represented as a single YAML document comprised of the mapping
defined in table :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-code-object-metadata-map-v2-table` and
referenced tables.

For boolean values, the string values of ``false`` and ``true`` are used for
false and true respectively.

Additional information can be added to the mappings. To avoid conflicts, any
non-AMD key names should be prefixed by "*vendor-name*.".

Code Object V3 Metadata
+++++++++++++++++++++++

.. warning::
  Code object V3 is not the default code object version emitted by this version
  of LLVM.

Code object V3 and above metadata is specified by the ``NT_AMDGPU_METADATA`` note
record (see :ref:`amdgpu-note-records-v3-onwards`).

The metadata is represented as Message Pack formatted binary data (see
[MsgPack]_). The top level is a Message Pack map that includes the
keys defined in table
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-code-object-metadata-map-table-v3` and referenced
tables.

Additional information can be added to the maps. To avoid conflicts,
any key names should be prefixed by "*vendor-name*." where
``vendor-name`` can be the name of the vendor and specific vendor
tool that generates the information. The prefix is abbreviated to
simply "." when it appears within a map that has been added by the
same *vendor-name*.

Kernel Dispatch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The HSA architected queuing language (AQL) defines a user space memory interface
that can be used to control the dispatch of kernels, in an agent independent
way. An agent can have zero or more AQL queues created for it using an HSA
compatible runtime (see :ref:`amdgpu-os`), in which AQL packets (all of which
are 64 bytes) can be placed. See the *HSA Platform System Architecture
Specification* [HSA]_ for the AQL queue mechanics and packet layouts.

The packet processor of a kernel agent is responsible for detecting and
dispatching HSA kernels from the AQL queues associated with it. For AMD GPUs the
packet processor is implemented by the hardware command processor (CP),
asynchronous dispatch controller (ADC) and shader processor input controller
(SPI).

An HSA compatible runtime can be used to allocate an AQL queue object. It uses
the kernel mode driver to initialize and register the AQL queue with CP.

To dispatch a kernel the following actions are performed. This can occur in the
CPU host program, or from an HSA kernel executing on a GPU.

1. A pointer to an AQL queue for the kernel agent on which the kernel is to be
   executed is obtained.
2. A pointer to the kernel descriptor (see
   :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-descriptor`) of the kernel to execute is obtained.
   It must be for a kernel that is contained in a code object that was loaded
   by an HSA compatible runtime on the kernel agent with which the AQL queue is
   associated.
3. Space is allocated for the kernel arguments using the HSA compatible runtime
   allocator for a memory region with the kernarg property for the kernel agent
   that will execute the kernel. It must be at least 16-byte aligned.
4. Kernel argument values are assigned to the kernel argument memory
   allocation. The layout is defined in the *HSA Programmer's Language
   Reference* [HSA]_. For AMDGPU the kernel execution directly accesses the
   kernel argument memory in the same way constant memory is accessed. (Note
   that the HSA specification allows an implementation to copy the kernel
   argument contents to another location that is accessed by the kernel.)
5. An AQL kernel dispatch packet is created on the AQL queue. The HSA compatible
   runtime api uses 64-bit atomic operations to reserve space in the AQL queue
   for the packet. The packet must be set up, and the final write must use an
   atomic store release to set the packet kind to ensure the packet contents are
   visible to the kernel agent. AQL defines a doorbell signal mechanism to
   notify the kernel agent that the AQL queue has been updated. These rules, and
   the layout of the AQL queue and kernel dispatch packet is defined in the *HSA
   System Architecture Specification* [HSA]_.
6. A kernel dispatch packet includes information about the actual dispatch,
   such as grid and work-group size, together with information from the code
   object about the kernel, such as segment sizes. The HSA compatible runtime
   queries on the kernel symbol can be used to obtain the code object values
   which are recorded in the :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-code-object-metadata`.
7. CP executes micro-code and is responsible for detecting and setting up the
   GPU to execute the wavefronts of a kernel dispatch.
8. CP ensures that when the a wavefront starts executing the kernel machine
   code, the scalar general purpose registers (SGPR) and vector general purpose
   registers (VGPR) are set up as required by the machine code. The required
   setup is defined in the :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-descriptor`. The initial
   register state is defined in
   :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state`.
9. The prolog of the kernel machine code (see
   :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog`) sets up the machine state as necessary
   before continuing executing the machine code that corresponds to the kernel.
10. When the kernel dispatch has completed execution, CP signals the completion
    signal specified in the kernel dispatch packet if not 0.

     ================= =========== ======== ======= ==================

The global and constant memory spaces both use global virtual addresses, which
are the same virtual address space used by the CPU. However, some virtual
addresses may only be accessible to the CPU, some only accessible by the GPU,
and some by both.

Using the constant memory space indicates that the data will not change during
the execution of the kernel. This allows scalar read instructions to be
used. The vector and scalar L1 caches are invalidated of volatile data before
each kernel dispatch execution to allow constant memory to change values between
kernel dispatches.

The local memory space uses the hardware Local Data Store (LDS) which is
automatically allocated when the hardware creates work-groups of wavefronts, and
freed when all the wavefronts of a work-group have terminated. The data store
(DS) instructions can be used to access it.

The private memory space uses the hardware scratch memory support. If the kernel
uses scratch, then the hardware allocates memory that is accessed using
wavefront lane dword (4 byte) interleaving. The mapping used from private
address to physical address is:

  ``wavefront-scratch-base +
  (private-address * wavefront-size * 4) +
  (wavefront-lane-id * 4)``

There are different ways that the wavefront scratch base address is determined
by a wavefront (see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state`). This
memory can be accessed in an interleaved manner using buffer instruction with
the scratch buffer descriptor and per wavefront scratch offset, by the scratch
instructions, or by flat instructions. If each lane of a wavefront accesses the
same private address, the interleaving results in adjacent dwords being accessed
and hence requires fewer cache lines to be fetched. Multi-dword access is not
supported except by flat and scratch instructions in GFX9-GFX11.

The generic address space uses the hardware flat address support available in
GFX7-GFX11. This uses two fixed ranges of virtual addresses (the private and
local apertures), that are outside the range of addressible global memory, to
map from a flat address to a private or local address.

FLAT instructions can take a flat address and access global, private (scratch)
and group (LDS) memory depending on if the address is within one of the
aperture ranges. Flat access to scratch requires hardware aperture setup and
setup in the kernel prologue (see
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-flat-scratch`). Flat access to LDS requires
hardware aperture setup and M0 (GFX7-GFX8) register setup (see
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-m0`).

To convert between a segment address and a flat address the base address of the
apertures address can be used. For GFX7-GFX8 these are available in the
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-hsa-aql-queue` the address of which can be obtained with
Queue Ptr SGPR (see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state`). For
GFX9-GFX11 the aperture base addresses are directly available as inline constant
registers ``SRC_SHARED_BASE/LIMIT`` and ``SRC_PRIVATE_BASE/LIMIT``. In 64 bit
address mode the aperture sizes are 2^32 bytes and the base is aligned to 2^32
which makes it easier to convert from flat to segment or segment to flat.

Image and Samplers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Image and sample handles created by an HSA compatible runtime (see
:ref:`amdgpu-os`) are 64-bit addresses of a hardware 32-byte V# and 48 byte S#
object respectively. In order to support the HSA ``query_sampler`` operations
two extra dwords are used to store the HSA BRIG enumeration values for the
queries that are not trivially deducible from the S# representation.

HSA Signals
~~~~~~~~~~~

HSA signal handles created by an HSA compatible runtime (see :ref:`amdgpu-os`)
are 64-bit addresses of a structure allocated in memory accessible from both the
CPU and GPU. The structure is defined by the runtime and subject to change
between releases. For example, see [AMD-ROCm-github]_.

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-hsa-aql-queue:

HSA AQL Queue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The HSA AQL queue structure is defined by an HSA compatible runtime (see
:ref:`amdgpu-os`) and subject to change between releases. For example, see
[AMD-ROCm-github]_. For some processors it contains fields needed to implement
certain language features such as the flat address aperture bases. It also
contains fields used by CP such as managing the allocation of scratch memory.

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-descriptor:

Kernel Descriptor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A kernel descriptor consists of the information needed by CP to initiate the
execution of a kernel, including the entry point address of the machine code
that implements the kernel.

Code Object V3 Kernel Descriptor
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

CP microcode requires the Kernel descriptor to be allocated on 64-byte
alignment.

The fields used by CP for code objects before V3 also match those specified in
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-descriptor-v3-table`.

Initial Kernel Execution State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section defines the register state that will be set up by the packet
processor prior to the start of execution of every wavefront. This is limited by
the constraints of the hardware controllers of CP/ADC/SPI.

The order of the SGPR registers is defined, but the compiler can specify which
ones are actually setup in the kernel descriptor using the ``enable_sgpr_*`` bit
fields (see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-descriptor`). The register numbers used
for enabled registers are dense starting at SGPR0: the first enabled register is
SGPR0, the next enabled register is SGPR1 etc.; disabled registers do not have
an SGPR number.

The initial SGPRs comprise up to 16 User SRGPs that are set by CP and apply to
all wavefronts of the grid. It is possible to specify more than 16 User SGPRs
using the ``enable_sgpr_*`` bit fields, in which case only the first 16 are
actually initialized. These are then immediately followed by the System SGPRs
that are set up by ADC/SPI and can have different values for each wavefront of
the grid dispatch.

SGPR register initial state is defined in
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-sgpr-register-set-up-order-table`.

     ========== ========================== ====== ==============================

The order of the VGPR registers is defined, but the compiler can specify which
ones are actually setup in the kernel descriptor using the ``enable_vgpr*`` bit
fields (see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-descriptor`). The register numbers used
for enabled registers are dense starting at VGPR0: the first enabled register is
VGPR0, the next enabled register is VGPR1 etc.; disabled registers do not have a
VGPR number.

There are different methods used for the VGPR initial state:

* Unless the *Target Properties* column of :ref:`amdgpu-processor-table`
  specifies otherwise, a separate VGPR register is used per work-item ID. The
  VGPR register initial state for this method is defined in
  :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-vgpr-register-set-up-order-for-unpacked-work-item-id-method-table`.
* If *Target Properties* column of :ref:`amdgpu-processor-table`
  specifies *Packed work-item IDs*, the initial value of VGPR0 register is used
  for all work-item IDs. The register layout for this method is defined in
  :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-register-layout-for-packed-work-item-id-method-table`.

     ======= ======= ================ =========================================

The setting of registers is done by GPU CP/ADC/SPI hardware as follows:

1. SGPRs before the Work-Group Ids are set by CP using the 16 User Data
   registers.
2. Work-group Id registers X, Y, Z are set by ADC which supports any
   combination including none.
3. Scratch Wavefront Offset is set by SPI in a per wavefront basis which is why
   its value cannot be included with the flat scratch init value which is per
   queue (see :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-flat-scratch`).
4. The VGPRs are set by SPI which only supports specifying either (X), (X, Y)
   or (X, Y, Z).
5. Flat Scratch register pair initialization is described in
   :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-flat-scratch`.

The global segment can be accessed either using buffer instructions (GFX6 which
has V# 64-bit address support), flat instructions (GFX7-GFX11), or global
instructions (GFX9-GFX11).

If buffer operations are used, then the compiler can generate a V# with the
following properties:

* base address of 0
* no swizzle
* ATC: 1 if IOMMU present (such as APU)
* ptr64: 1
* MTYPE set to support memory coherence that matches the runtime (such as CC for
  APU and NC for dGPU).

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog:

Kernel Prolog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The compiler performs initialization in the kernel prologue depending on the
target and information about things like stack usage in the kernel and called
functions. Some of this initialization requires the compiler to request certain
User and System SGPRs be present in the
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state` via the
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-descriptor`.

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-cfi:

CFI
+++

1.  The CFI return address is undefined.

2.  The CFI CFA is defined using an expression which evaluates to a location
    description that comprises one memory location description for the
    ``DW_ASPACE_AMDGPU_private_lane`` address space address ``0``.

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-m0:

M0
++

GFX6-GFX8
  The M0 register must be initialized with a value at least the total LDS size
  if the kernel may access LDS via DS or flat operations. Total LDS size is
  available in dispatch packet. For M0, it is also possible to use maximum
  possible value of LDS for given target (0x7FFF for GFX6 and 0xFFFF for
  GFX7-GFX8).
GFX9-GFX11
  The M0 register is not used for range checking LDS accesses and so does not
  need to be initialized in the prolog.

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-stack-pointer:

Stack Pointer
+++++++++++++

If the kernel has function calls it must set up the ABI stack pointer described
in :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-function-call-convention-non-kernel-functions` by setting
SGPR32 to the unswizzled scratch offset of the address past the last local
allocation.

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-frame-pointer:

Frame Pointer
+++++++++++++

If the kernel needs a frame pointer for the reasons defined in
``SIFrameLowering`` then SGPR33 is used and is always set to ``0`` in the
kernel prolog. If a frame pointer is not required then all uses of the frame
pointer are replaced with immediate ``0`` offsets.

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-flat-scratch:

Flat Scratch
++++++++++++

There are different methods used for initializing flat scratch:

* If the *Target Properties* column of :ref:`amdgpu-processor-table`
  specifies *Does not support generic address space*:

  Flat scratch is not supported and there is no flat scratch register pair.

* If the *Target Properties* column of :ref:`amdgpu-processor-table`
  specifies *Offset flat scratch*:

  If the kernel or any function it calls may use flat operations to access
  scratch memory, the prolog code must set up the FLAT_SCRATCH register pair
  (FLAT_SCRATCH_LO/FLAT_SCRATCH_HI). Initialization uses Flat Scratch Init and
  Scratch Wavefront Offset SGPR registers (see
  :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state`):

  1. The low word of Flat Scratch Init is the 32-bit byte offset from
     ``SH_HIDDEN_PRIVATE_BASE_VIMID`` to the base of scratch backing memory
     being managed by SPI for the queue executing the kernel dispatch. This is
     the same value used in the Scratch Segment Buffer V# base address.

     CP obtains this from the runtime. (The Scratch Segment Buffer base address
     is ``SH_HIDDEN_PRIVATE_BASE_VIMID`` plus this offset.)

     The prolog must add the value of Scratch Wavefront Offset to get the
     wavefront's byte scratch backing memory offset from
     ``SH_HIDDEN_PRIVATE_BASE_VIMID``.

     The Scratch Wavefront Offset must also be used as an offset with Private
     segment address when using the Scratch Segment Buffer.

     Since FLAT_SCRATCH_LO is in units of 256 bytes, the offset must be right
     shifted by 8 before moving into FLAT_SCRATCH_HI.

     FLAT_SCRATCH_HI corresponds to SGPRn-4 on GFX7, and SGPRn-6 on GFX8 (where
     SGPRn is the highest numbered SGPR allocated to the wavefront).
     FLAT_SCRATCH_HI is multiplied by 256 (as it is in units of 256 bytes) and
     added to ``SH_HIDDEN_PRIVATE_BASE_VIMID`` to calculate the per wavefront
     FLAT SCRATCH BASE in flat memory instructions that access the scratch
     aperture.
  2. The second word of Flat Scratch Init is 32-bit byte size of a single
     work-items scratch memory usage.

     CP obtains this from the runtime, and it is always a multiple of DWORD. CP
     checks that the value in the kernel dispatch packet Private Segment Byte
     Size is not larger and requests the runtime to increase the queue's scratch
     size if necessary.

     CP directly loads from the kernel dispatch packet Private Segment Byte Size
     field and rounds up to a multiple of DWORD. Having CP load it once avoids
     loading it at the beginning of every wavefront.

     The kernel prolog code must move it to FLAT_SCRATCH_LO which is SGPRn-3 on
     GFX7 and SGPRn-5 on GFX8. FLAT_SCRATCH_LO is used as the FLAT SCRATCH SIZE
     in flat memory instructions.

* If the *Target Properties* column of :ref:`amdgpu-processor-table`
  specifies *Absolute flat scratch*:

  If the kernel or any function it calls may use flat operations to access
  scratch memory, the prolog code must set up the FLAT_SCRATCH register pair
  (FLAT_SCRATCH_LO/FLAT_SCRATCH_HI which are in SGPRn-4/SGPRn-3). Initialization
  uses Flat Scratch Init and Scratch Wavefront Offset SGPR registers (see
  :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state`):

  The Flat Scratch Init is the 64-bit address of the base of scratch backing
  memory being managed by SPI for the queue executing the kernel dispatch.

  CP obtains this from the runtime.

  The kernel prolog must add the value of the wave's Scratch Wavefront Offset
  and move the result as a 64-bit value to the FLAT_SCRATCH SGPR register pair
  which is SGPRn-6 and SGPRn-5. It is used as the FLAT SCRATCH BASE in flat
  memory instructions.

  The Scratch Wavefront Offset must also be used as an offset with Private
  segment address when using the Scratch Segment Buffer (see
  :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-private-segment-buffer`).

* If the *Target Properties* column of :ref:`amdgpu-processor-table`
  specifies *Architected flat scratch*:

  If ENABLE_PRIVATE_SEGMENT is enabled in
  :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-compute_pgm_rsrc2-gfx6-gfx11-table` then the FLAT_SCRATCH
  register pair will be initialized to the 64-bit address of the base of scratch
  backing memory being managed by SPI for the queue executing the kernel
  dispatch plus the value of the wave's Scratch Wavefront Offset for use as the
  flat scratch base in flat memory instructions.

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-kernel-prolog-private-segment-buffer:

Private Segment Buffer
++++++++++++++++++++++

If the *Target Properties* column of :ref:`amdgpu-processor-table` specifies
*Architected flat scratch* then a Private Segment Buffer is not supported.
Instead the flat SCRATCH instructions are used.

Otherwise, Private Segment Buffer SGPR register is used to initialize 4 SGPRs
that are used as a V# to access scratch. CP uses the value provided by the
runtime. It is used, together with Scratch Wavefront Offset as an offset, to
access the private memory space using a segment address. See
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state`.

The scratch V# is a four-aligned SGPR and always selected for the kernel as
follows:

  - If it is known during instruction selection that there is stack usage,
    SGPR0-3 is reserved for use as the scratch V#.  Stack usage is assumed if
    optimizations are disabled (``-O0``), if stack objects already exist (for
    locals, etc.), or if there are any function calls.

  - Otherwise, four high numbered SGPRs beginning at a four-aligned SGPR index
    are reserved for the tentative scratch V#. These will be used if it is
    determined that spilling is needed.

    - If no use is made of the tentative scratch V#, then it is unreserved,
      and the register count is determined ignoring it.
    - If use is made of the tentative scratch V#, then its register numbers
      are shifted to the first four-aligned SGPR index after the highest one
      allocated by the register allocator, and all uses are updated. The
      register count includes them in the shifted location.
    - In either case, if the processor has the SGPR allocation bug, the
      tentative allocation is not shifted or unreserved in order to ensure
      the register count is higher to workaround the bug.

    .. note::

      This approach of using a tentative scratch V# and shifting the register
      numbers if used avoids having to perform register allocation a second
      time if the tentative V# is eliminated. This is more efficient and
      avoids the problem that the second register allocation may perform
      spilling which will fail as there is no longer a scratch V#.

When the kernel prolog code is being emitted it is known whether the scratch V#
described above is actually used. If it is, the prolog code must set it up by
copying the Private Segment Buffer to the scratch V# registers and then adding
the Private Segment Wavefront Offset to the queue base address in the V#. The
result is a V# with a base address pointing to the beginning of the wavefront
scratch backing memory.

The Private Segment Buffer is always requested, but the Private Segment
Wavefront Offset is only requested if it is used (see
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-initial-kernel-execution-state`).

.. _amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-model:

Memory Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section describes the mapping of the LLVM memory model onto AMDGPU machine
code (see :ref:`memmodel`).

The AMDGPU backend supports the memory synchronization scopes specified in
:ref:`amdgpu-memory-scopes`.

The code sequences used to implement the memory model specify the order of
instructions that a single thread must execute. The ``s_waitcnt`` and cache
management instructions such as ``buffer_wbinvl1_vol`` are defined with respect
to other memory instructions executed by the same thread. This allows them to be
moved earlier or later which can allow them to be combined with other instances
of the same instruction, or hoisted/sunk out of loops to improve performance.
Only the instructions related to the memory model are given; additional
``s_waitcnt`` instructions are required to ensure registers are defined before
being used. These may be able to be combined with the memory model ``s_waitcnt``
instructions as described above.

The AMDGPU backend supports the following memory models:

  HSA Memory Model [HSA]_
    The HSA memory model uses a single happens-before relation for all address
    spaces (see :ref:`amdgpu-address-spaces`).
  OpenCL Memory Model [OpenCL]_
    The OpenCL memory model which has separate happens-before relations for the
    global and local address spaces. Only a fence specifying both global and
    local address space, and seq_cst instructions join the relationships. Since
    the LLVM ``memfence`` instruction does not allow an address space to be
    specified the OpenCL fence has to conservatively assume both local and
    global address space was specified. However, optimizations can often be
    done to eliminate the additional ``s_waitcnt`` instructions when there are
    no intervening memory instructions which access the corresponding address
    space. The code sequences in the table indicate what can be omitted for the
    OpenCL memory. The target triple environment is used to determine if the
    source language is OpenCL (see :ref:`amdgpu-opencl`).

``ds/flat_load/store/atomic`` instructions to local memory are termed LDS
operations.

``buffer/global/flat_load/store/atomic`` instructions to global memory are
termed vector memory operations.

Private address space uses ``buffer_load/store`` using the scratch V#
(GFX6-GFX8), or ``scratch_load/store`` (GFX9-GFX11). Since only a single thread
is accessing the memory, atomic memory orderings are not meaningful, and all
accesses are treated as non-atomic.

Constant address space uses ``buffer/global_load`` instructions (or equivalent
scalar memory instructions). Since the constant address space contents do not
change during the execution of a kernel dispatch it is not legal to perform
stores, and atomic memory orderings are not meaningful, and all accesses are
treated as non-atomic.

A memory synchronization scope wider than work-group is not meaningful for the
group (LDS) address space and is treated as work-group.

The memory model does not support the region address space which is treated as
non-atomic.

Acquire memory ordering is not meaningful on store atomic instructions and is
treated as non-atomic.

Release memory ordering is not meaningful on load atomic instructions and is
treated a non-atomic.

Acquire-release memory ordering is not meaningful on load or store atomic
instructions and is treated as acquire and release respectively.

The memory order also adds the single thread optimization constraints defined in
table
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-model-single-thread-optimization-constraints-table`.

Memory Model GFX6-GFX9
++++++++++++++++++++++

For GFX6-GFX9:

* Each agent has multiple shader arrays (SA).
* Each SA has multiple compute units (CU).
* Each CU has multiple SIMDs that execute wavefronts.
* The wavefronts for a single work-group are executed in the same CU but may be
  executed by different SIMDs.
* Each CU has a single LDS memory shared by the wavefronts of the work-groups
  executing on it.
* All LDS operations of a CU are performed as wavefront wide operations in a
  global order and involve no caching. Completion is reported to a wavefront in
  execution order.
* The LDS memory has multiple request queues shared by the SIMDs of a
  CU. Therefore, the LDS operations performed by different wavefronts of a
  work-group can be reordered relative to each other, which can result in
  reordering the visibility of vector memory operations with respect to LDS
  operations of other wavefronts in the same work-group. A ``s_waitcnt
  lgkmcnt(0)`` is required to ensure synchronization between LDS operations and
  vector memory operations between wavefronts of a work-group, but not between
  operations performed by the same wavefront.
* The vector memory operations are performed as wavefront wide operations and
  completion is reported to a wavefront in execution order. The exception is
  that for GFX7-GFX9 ``flat_load/store/atomic`` instructions can report out of
  vector memory order if they access LDS memory, and out of LDS operation order
  if they access global memory.
* The vector memory operations access a single vector L1 cache shared by all
  SIMDs a CU. Therefore, no special action is required for coherence between the
  lanes of a single wavefront, or for coherence between wavefronts in the same
  work-group. A ``buffer_wbinvl1_vol`` is required for coherence between
  wavefronts executing in different work-groups as they may be executing on
  different CUs.
* The scalar memory operations access a scalar L1 cache shared by all wavefronts
  on a group of CUs. The scalar and vector L1 caches are not coherent. However,
  scalar operations are used in a restricted way so do not impact the memory
  model. See :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-spaces`.
* The vector and scalar memory operations use an L2 cache shared by all CUs on
  the same agent.
* The L2 cache has independent channels to service disjoint ranges of virtual
  addresses.
* Each CU has a separate request queue per channel. Therefore, the vector and
  scalar memory operations performed by wavefronts executing in different
  work-groups (which may be executing on different CUs) of an agent can be
  reordered relative to each other. A ``s_waitcnt vmcnt(0)`` is required to
  ensure synchronization between vector memory operations of different CUs. It
  ensures a previous vector memory operation has completed before executing a
  subsequent vector memory or LDS operation and so can be used to meet the
  requirements of acquire and release.
* The L2 cache can be kept coherent with other agents on some targets, or ranges
  of virtual addresses can be set up to bypass it to ensure system coherence.

Scalar memory operations are only used to access memory that is proven to not
change during the execution of the kernel dispatch. This includes constant
address space and global address space for program scope ``const`` variables.
Therefore, the kernel machine code does not have to maintain the scalar cache to
ensure it is coherent with the vector caches. The scalar and vector caches are
invalidated between kernel dispatches by CP since constant address space data
may change between kernel dispatch executions. See
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-spaces`.

The one exception is if scalar writes are used to spill SGPR registers. In this
case the AMDGPU backend ensures the memory location used to spill is never
accessed by vector memory operations at the same time. If scalar writes are used
then a ``s_dcache_wb`` is inserted before the ``s_endpgm`` and before a function
return since the locations may be used for vector memory instructions by a
future wavefront that uses the same scratch area, or a function call that
creates a frame at the same address, respectively. There is no need for a
``s_dcache_inv`` as all scalar writes are write-before-read in the same thread.

For kernarg backing memory:

* CP invalidates the L1 cache at the start of each kernel dispatch.
* On dGPU the kernarg backing memory is allocated in host memory accessed as
  MTYPE UC (uncached) to avoid needing to invalidate the L2 cache. This also
  causes it to be treated as non-volatile and so is not invalidated by
  ``*_vol``.
* On APU the kernarg backing memory it is accessed as MTYPE CC (cache coherent)
  and so the L2 cache will be coherent with the CPU and other agents.

Scratch backing memory (which is used for the private address space) is accessed
with MTYPE NC_NV (non-coherent non-volatile). Since the private address space is
only accessed by a single thread, and is always write-before-read, there is
never a need to invalidate these entries from the L1 cache. Hence all cache
invalidates are done as ``*_vol`` to only invalidate the volatile cache lines.

Memory Model GFX90A
+++++++++++++++++++

For GFX90A:

* Each agent has multiple shader arrays (SA).
* Each SA has multiple compute units (CU).
* Each CU has multiple SIMDs that execute wavefronts.
* The wavefronts for a single work-group are executed in the same CU but may be
  executed by different SIMDs. The exception is when in tgsplit execution mode
  when the wavefronts may be executed by different SIMDs in different CUs.
* Each CU has a single LDS memory shared by the wavefronts of the work-groups
  executing on it. The exception is when in tgsplit execution mode when no LDS
  is allocated as wavefronts of the same work-group can be in different CUs.
* All LDS operations of a CU are performed as wavefront wide operations in a
  global order and involve no caching. Completion is reported to a wavefront in
  execution order.
* The LDS memory has multiple request queues shared by the SIMDs of a
  CU. Therefore, the LDS operations performed by different wavefronts of a
  work-group can be reordered relative to each other, which can result in
  reordering the visibility of vector memory operations with respect to LDS
  operations of other wavefronts in the same work-group. A ``s_waitcnt
  lgkmcnt(0)`` is required to ensure synchronization between LDS operations and
  vector memory operations between wavefronts of a work-group, but not between
  operations performed by the same wavefront.
* The vector memory operations are performed as wavefront wide operations and
  completion is reported to a wavefront in execution order. The exception is
  that ``flat_load/store/atomic`` instructions can report out of vector memory
  order if they access LDS memory, and out of LDS operation order if they access
  global memory.
* The vector memory operations access a single vector L1 cache shared by all
  SIMDs a CU. Therefore:

  * No special action is required for coherence between the lanes of a single
    wavefront.

  * No special action is required for coherence between wavefronts in the same
    work-group since they execute on the same CU. The exception is when in
    tgsplit execution mode as wavefronts of the same work-group can be in
    different CUs and so a ``buffer_wbinvl1_vol`` is required as described in
    the following item.

  * A ``buffer_wbinvl1_vol`` is required for coherence between wavefronts
    executing in different work-groups as they may be executing on different
    CUs.

* The scalar memory operations access a scalar L1 cache shared by all wavefronts
  on a group of CUs. The scalar and vector L1 caches are not coherent. However,
  scalar operations are used in a restricted way so do not impact the memory
  model. See :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-spaces`.
* The vector and scalar memory operations use an L2 cache shared by all CUs on
  the same agent.

  * The L2 cache has independent channels to service disjoint ranges of virtual
    addresses.
  * Each CU has a separate request queue per channel. Therefore, the vector and
    scalar memory operations performed by wavefronts executing in different
    work-groups (which may be executing on different CUs), or the same
    work-group if executing in tgsplit mode, of an agent can be reordered
    relative to each other. A ``s_waitcnt vmcnt(0)`` is required to ensure
    synchronization between vector memory operations of different CUs. It
    ensures a previous vector memory operation has completed before executing a
    subsequent vector memory or LDS operation and so can be used to meet the
    requirements of acquire and release.
  * The L2 cache of one agent can be kept coherent with other agents by:
    using the MTYPE RW (read-write) or MTYPE CC (cache-coherent) with the PTE
    C-bit for memory local to the L2; and using the MTYPE NC (non-coherent) with
    the PTE C-bit set or MTYPE UC (uncached) for memory not local to the L2.

    * Any local memory cache lines will be automatically invalidated by writes
      from CUs associated with other L2 caches, or writes from the CPU, due to
      the cache probe caused by coherent requests. Coherent requests are caused
      by GPU accesses to pages with the PTE C-bit set, by CPU accesses over
      XGMI, and by PCIe requests that are configured to be coherent requests.
    * XGMI accesses from the CPU to local memory may be cached on the CPU.
      Subsequent access from the GPU will automatically invalidate or writeback
      the CPU cache due to the L2 probe filter and and the PTE C-bit being set.
    * Since all work-groups on the same agent share the same L2, no L2
      invalidation or writeback is required for coherence.
    * To ensure coherence of local and remote memory writes of work-groups in
      different agents a ``buffer_wbl2`` is required. It will writeback dirty L2
      cache lines of MTYPE RW (used for local coarse grain memory) and MTYPE NC
      ()used for remote coarse grain memory). Note that MTYPE CC (used for local
      fine grain memory) causes write through to DRAM, and MTYPE UC (used for
      remote fine grain memory) bypasses the L2, so both will never result in
      dirty L2 cache lines.
    * To ensure coherence of local and remote memory reads of work-groups in
      different agents a ``buffer_invl2`` is required. It will invalidate L2
      cache lines with MTYPE NC (used for remote coarse grain memory). Note that
      MTYPE CC (used for local fine grain memory) and MTYPE RW (used for local
      coarse memory) cause local reads to be invalidated by remote writes with
      with the PTE C-bit so these cache lines are not invalidated. Note that
      MTYPE UC (used for remote fine grain memory) bypasses the L2, so will
      never result in L2 cache lines that need to be invalidated.

  * PCIe access from the GPU to the CPU memory is kept coherent by using the
    MTYPE UC (uncached) which bypasses the L2.

Scalar memory operations are only used to access memory that is proven to not
change during the execution of the kernel dispatch. This includes constant
address space and global address space for program scope ``const`` variables.
Therefore, the kernel machine code does not have to maintain the scalar cache to
ensure it is coherent with the vector caches. The scalar and vector caches are
invalidated between kernel dispatches by CP since constant address space data
may change between kernel dispatch executions. See
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-spaces`.

The one exception is if scalar writes are used to spill SGPR registers. In this
case the AMDGPU backend ensures the memory location used to spill is never
accessed by vector memory operations at the same time. If scalar writes are used
then a ``s_dcache_wb`` is inserted before the ``s_endpgm`` and before a function
return since the locations may be used for vector memory instructions by a
future wavefront that uses the same scratch area, or a function call that
creates a frame at the same address, respectively. There is no need for a
``s_dcache_inv`` as all scalar writes are write-before-read in the same thread.

For kernarg backing memory:

* CP invalidates the L1 cache at the start of each kernel dispatch.
* On dGPU over XGMI or PCIe the kernarg backing memory is allocated in host
  memory accessed as MTYPE UC (uncached) to avoid needing to invalidate the L2
  cache. This also causes it to be treated as non-volatile and so is not
  invalidated by ``*_vol``.
* On APU the kernarg backing memory is accessed as MTYPE CC (cache coherent) and
  so the L2 cache will be coherent with the CPU and other agents.

Scratch backing memory (which is used for the private address space) is accessed
with MTYPE NC_NV (non-coherent non-volatile). Since the private address space is
only accessed by a single thread, and is always write-before-read, there is
never a need to invalidate these entries from the L1 cache. Hence all cache
invalidates are done as ``*_vol`` to only invalidate the volatile cache lines.

Memory Model GFX940
+++++++++++++++++++

For GFX940:

* Each agent has multiple shader arrays (SA).
* Each SA has multiple compute units (CU).
* Each CU has multiple SIMDs that execute wavefronts.
* The wavefronts for a single work-group are executed in the same CU but may be
  executed by different SIMDs. The exception is when in tgsplit execution mode
  when the wavefronts may be executed by different SIMDs in different CUs.
* Each CU has a single LDS memory shared by the wavefronts of the work-groups
  executing on it. The exception is when in tgsplit execution mode when no LDS
  is allocated as wavefronts of the same work-group can be in different CUs.
* All LDS operations of a CU are performed as wavefront wide operations in a
  global order and involve no caching. Completion is reported to a wavefront in
  execution order.
* The LDS memory has multiple request queues shared by the SIMDs of a
  CU. Therefore, the LDS operations performed by different wavefronts of a
  work-group can be reordered relative to each other, which can result in
  reordering the visibility of vector memory operations with respect to LDS
  operations of other wavefronts in the same work-group. A ``s_waitcnt
  lgkmcnt(0)`` is required to ensure synchronization between LDS operations and
  vector memory operations between wavefronts of a work-group, but not between
  operations performed by the same wavefront.
* The vector memory operations are performed as wavefront wide operations and
  completion is reported to a wavefront in execution order. The exception is
  that ``flat_load/store/atomic`` instructions can report out of vector memory
  order if they access LDS memory, and out of LDS operation order if they access
  global memory.
* The vector memory operations access a single vector L1 cache shared by all
  SIMDs a CU. Therefore:

  * No special action is required for coherence between the lanes of a single
    wavefront.

  * No special action is required for coherence between wavefronts in the same
    work-group since they execute on the same CU. The exception is when in
    tgsplit execution mode as wavefronts of the same work-group can be in
    different CUs and so a ``buffer_inv sc0`` is required which will invalidate
    the L1 cache.

  * A ``buffer_inv sc0`` is required to invalidate the L1 cache for coherence
    between wavefronts executing in different work-groups as they may be
    executing on different CUs.

  * Atomic read-modify-write instructions implicitly bypass the L1 cache.
    Therefore, they do not use the sc0 bit for coherence and instead use it to
    indicate if the instruction returns the original value being updated. They
    do use sc1 to indicate system or agent scope coherence.

* The scalar memory operations access a scalar L1 cache shared by all wavefronts
  on a group of CUs. The scalar and vector L1 caches are not coherent. However,
  scalar operations are used in a restricted way so do not impact the memory
  model. See :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-spaces`.
* The vector and scalar memory operations use an L2 cache.

  * The gfx940 can be configured as a number of smaller agents with each having
    a single L2 shared by all CUs on the same agent, or as fewer (possibly one)
    larger agents with groups of CUs on each agent each sharing separate L2
    caches.
  * The L2 cache has independent channels to service disjoint ranges of virtual
    addresses.
  * Each CU has a separate request queue per channel for its associated L2.
    Therefore, the vector and scalar memory operations performed by wavefronts
    executing with different L1 caches and the same L2 cache can be reordered
    relative to each other.
  * A ``s_waitcnt vmcnt(0)`` is required to ensure synchronization between
    vector memory operations of different CUs. It ensures a previous vector
    memory operation has completed before executing a subsequent vector memory
    or LDS operation and so can be used to meet the requirements of acquire and
    release.
  * An L2 cache can be kept coherent with other L2 caches by using the MTYPE RW
    (read-write) for memory local to the L2, and MTYPE NC (non-coherent) with
    the PTE C-bit set for memory not local to the L2.

    * Any local memory cache lines will be automatically invalidated by writes
      from CUs associated with other L2 caches, or writes from the CPU, due to
      the cache probe caused by the PTE C-bit.
    * XGMI accesses from the CPU to local memory may be cached on the CPU.
      Subsequent access from the GPU will automatically invalidate or writeback
      the CPU cache due to the L2 probe filter.
    * To ensure coherence of local memory writes of CUs with different L1 caches
      in the same agent a ``buffer_wbl2`` is required. It does nothing if the
      agent is configured to have a single L2, or will writeback dirty L2 cache
      lines if configured to have multiple L2 caches.
    * To ensure coherence of local memory writes of CUs in different agents a
      ``buffer_wbl2 sc1`` is required. It will writeback dirty L2 cache lines.
    * To ensure coherence of local memory reads of CUs with different L1 caches
      in the same agent a ``buffer_inv sc1`` is required. It does nothing if the
      agent is configured to have a single L2, or will invalidate non-local L2
      cache lines if configured to have multiple L2 caches.
    * To ensure coherence of local memory reads of CUs in different agents a
      ``buffer_inv sc0 sc1`` is required. It will invalidate non-local L2 cache
      lines if configured to have multiple L2 caches.

  * PCIe access from the GPU to the CPU can be kept coherent by using the MTYPE
    UC (uncached) which bypasses the L2.

Scalar memory operations are only used to access memory that is proven to not
change during the execution of the kernel dispatch. This includes constant
address space and global address space for program scope ``const`` variables.
Therefore, the kernel machine code does not have to maintain the scalar cache to
ensure it is coherent with the vector caches. The scalar and vector caches are
invalidated between kernel dispatches by CP since constant address space data
may change between kernel dispatch executions. See
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-spaces`.

The one exception is if scalar writes are used to spill SGPR registers. In this
case the AMDGPU backend ensures the memory location used to spill is never
accessed by vector memory operations at the same time. If scalar writes are used
then a ``s_dcache_wb`` is inserted before the ``s_endpgm`` and before a function
return since the locations may be used for vector memory instructions by a
future wavefront that uses the same scratch area, or a function call that
creates a frame at the same address, respectively. There is no need for a
``s_dcache_inv`` as all scalar writes are write-before-read in the same thread.

For kernarg backing memory:

* CP invalidates the L1 cache at the start of each kernel dispatch.
* On dGPU over XGMI or PCIe the kernarg backing memory is allocated in host
  memory accessed as MTYPE UC (uncached) to avoid needing to invalidate the L2
  cache. This also causes it to be treated as non-volatile and so is not
  invalidated by ``*_vol``.
* On APU the kernarg backing memory is accessed as MTYPE CC (cache coherent) and
  so the L2 cache will be coherent with the CPU and other agents.

Scratch backing memory (which is used for the private address space) is accessed
with MTYPE NC_NV (non-coherent non-volatile). Since the private address space is
only accessed by a single thread, and is always write-before-read, there is
never a need to invalidate these entries from the L1 cache. Hence all cache
invalidates are done as ``*_vol`` to only invalidate the volatile cache lines.

Memory Model GFX10-GFX11
++++++++++++++++++++++++

For GFX10-GFX11:

* Each agent has multiple shader arrays (SA).
* Each SA has multiple work-group processors (WGP).
* Each WGP has multiple compute units (CU).
* Each CU has multiple SIMDs that execute wavefronts.
* The wavefronts for a single work-group are executed in the same
  WGP. In CU wavefront execution mode the wavefronts may be executed by
  different SIMDs in the same CU. In WGP wavefront execution mode the
  wavefronts may be executed by different SIMDs in different CUs in the same
  WGP.
* Each WGP has a single LDS memory shared by the wavefronts of the work-groups
  executing on it.
* All LDS operations of a WGP are performed as wavefront wide operations in a
  global order and involve no caching. Completion is reported to a wavefront in
  execution order.
* The LDS memory has multiple request queues shared by the SIMDs of a
  WGP. Therefore, the LDS operations performed by different wavefronts of a
  work-group can be reordered relative to each other, which can result in
  reordering the visibility of vector memory operations with respect to LDS
  operations of other wavefronts in the same work-group. A ``s_waitcnt
  lgkmcnt(0)`` is required to ensure synchronization between LDS operations and
  vector memory operations between wavefronts of a work-group, but not between
  operations performed by the same wavefront.
* The vector memory operations are performed as wavefront wide operations.
  Completion of load/store/sample operations are reported to a wavefront in
  execution order of other load/store/sample operations performed by that
  wavefront.
* The vector memory operations access a vector L0 cache. There is a single L0
  cache per CU. Each SIMD of a CU accesses the same L0 cache. Therefore, no
  special action is required for coherence between the lanes of a single
  wavefront. However, a ``buffer_gl0_inv`` is required for coherence between
  wavefronts executing in the same work-group as they may be executing on SIMDs
  of different CUs that access different L0s. A ``buffer_gl0_inv`` is also
  required for coherence between wavefronts executing in different work-groups
  as they may be executing on different WGPs.
* The scalar memory operations access a scalar L0 cache shared by all wavefronts
  on a WGP. The scalar and vector L0 caches are not coherent. However, scalar
  operations are used in a restricted way so do not impact the memory model. See
  :ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-spaces`.
* The vector and scalar memory L0 caches use an L1 cache shared by all WGPs on
  the same SA. Therefore, no special action is required for coherence between
  the wavefronts of a single work-group. However, a ``buffer_gl1_inv`` is
  required for coherence between wavefronts executing in different work-groups
  as they may be executing on different SAs that access different L1s.
* The L1 caches have independent quadrants to service disjoint ranges of virtual
  addresses.
* Each L0 cache has a separate request queue per L1 quadrant. Therefore, the
  vector and scalar memory operations performed by different wavefronts, whether
  executing in the same or different work-groups (which may be executing on
  different CUs accessing different L0s), can be reordered relative to each
  other. A ``s_waitcnt vmcnt(0) & vscnt(0)`` is required to ensure
  synchronization between vector memory operations of different wavefronts. It
  ensures a previous vector memory operation has completed before executing a
  subsequent vector memory or LDS operation and so can be used to meet the
  requirements of acquire, release and sequential consistency.
* The L1 caches use an L2 cache shared by all SAs on the same agent.
* The L2 cache has independent channels to service disjoint ranges of virtual
  addresses.
* Each L1 quadrant of a single SA accesses a different L2 channel. Each L1
  quadrant has a separate request queue per L2 channel. Therefore, the vector
  and scalar memory operations performed by wavefronts executing in different
  work-groups (which may be executing on different SAs) of an agent can be
  reordered relative to each other. A ``s_waitcnt vmcnt(0) & vscnt(0)`` is
  required to ensure synchronization between vector memory operations of
  different SAs. It ensures a previous vector memory operation has completed
  before executing a subsequent vector memory and so can be used to meet the
  requirements of acquire, release and sequential consistency.
* The L2 cache can be kept coherent with other agents on some targets, or ranges
  of virtual addresses can be set up to bypass it to ensure system coherence.
* On GFX10.3 and GFX11 a memory attached last level (MALL) cache exists for GPU memory.
  The MALL cache is fully coherent with GPU memory and has no impact on system
  coherence. All agents (GPU and CPU) access GPU memory through the MALL cache.

Scalar memory operations are only used to access memory that is proven to not
change during the execution of the kernel dispatch. This includes constant
address space and global address space for program scope ``const`` variables.
Therefore, the kernel machine code does not have to maintain the scalar cache to
ensure it is coherent with the vector caches. The scalar and vector caches are
invalidated between kernel dispatches by CP since constant address space data
may change between kernel dispatch executions. See
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-memory-spaces`.

The one exception is if scalar writes are used to spill SGPR registers. In this
case the AMDGPU backend ensures the memory location used to spill is never
accessed by vector memory operations at the same time. If scalar writes are used
then a ``s_dcache_wb`` is inserted before the ``s_endpgm`` and before a function
return since the locations may be used for vector memory instructions by a
future wavefront that uses the same scratch area, or a function call that
creates a frame at the same address, respectively. There is no need for a
``s_dcache_inv`` as all scalar writes are write-before-read in the same thread.

For kernarg backing memory:

* CP invalidates the L0 and L1 caches at the start of each kernel dispatch.
* On dGPU the kernarg backing memory is accessed as MTYPE UC (uncached) to avoid
  needing to invalidate the L2 cache.
* On APU the kernarg backing memory is accessed as MTYPE CC (cache coherent) and
  so the L2 cache will be coherent with the CPU and other agents.

Scratch backing memory (which is used for the private address space) is accessed
with MTYPE NC (non-coherent). Since the private address space is only accessed
by a single thread, and is always write-before-read, there is never a need to
invalidate these entries from the L0 or L1 caches.

Wavefronts are executed in native mode with in-order reporting of loads and
sample instructions. In this mode vmcnt reports completion of load, atomic with
return and sample instructions in order, and the vscnt reports the completion of
store and atomic without return in order. See ``MEM_ORDERED`` field in
:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-compute_pgm_rsrc1-gfx6-gfx11-table`.

Wavefronts can be executed in WGP or CU wavefront execution mode:

* In WGP wavefront execution mode the wavefronts of a work-group are executed
  on the SIMDs of both CUs of the WGP. Therefore, explicit management of the per
  CU L0 caches is required for work-group synchronization. Also accesses to L1
  at work-group scope need to be explicitly ordered as the accesses from
  different CUs are not ordered.
* In CU wavefront execution mode the wavefronts of a work-group are executed on
  the SIMDs of a single CU of the WGP. Therefore, all global memory access by
  the work-group access the same L0 which in turn ensures L1 accesses are
  ordered and so do not require explicit management of the caches for
  work-group synchronization.

:ref:`amdgpu-amdhsa-compute_pgm_rsrc1-gfx6-gfx11-table` and
:ref:`amdgpu-target-features`.
